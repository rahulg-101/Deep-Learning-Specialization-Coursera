# Deep-Learning-Specialization-Coursera

#### Complete course along with lecture slides,additional notes and project notebooks taught by the famous Andrew Ng !! 

1. This repository is for those interested in learning Deep-Learning from scratch and although it's not necessary but its good to have basic understanding of machine learning (You can refer [https://github.com/rahulg-101/Complete-Machine-Learning-Guide-using-Scikit-Learn], mathematics behind few algorithms like Logistic Regression, and python knowledge.
2. Also, if you are not very fond of getting a certificate and rather want to just expand your knowledge base in the field or if you're also a little short on budget to purchase the actual course, then you are at THE RIGHT PLACE !! 

> ## Important Note:
> This repo although has all the contents associated with the original course but **`SOME PROJECTS`** from particular weeks if you try to run locally in your system might not work from Course 4(Week 2) & 5(Week 1 and Ungraded Labs 2 & 3 from Week 4) since the associated project dependencies were too large and due to GITHUB memory constraints, I was unable to push them into the repository.

### HEADS UP
The course is formulated in very simple and easy to understand way but since the course covers a whole lot of topics,so completing it might take some time but ITS TOTALLY WORTH !!
The videos associated with particular courses' of the specialization are also available on YouTube if you need them, so you have everything you need to get started !!

This repo consists of all the course lecture slides along with project notebooks present in a structured manner as present in the original course.
